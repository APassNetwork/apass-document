# ✨ Quick Start

#### > Create your Aptos account

If you are new to aptos, first you need a wallet to create an account.  Use the faucet to get some APT coins, to pay for your domain name registration.

#### > What wallet should I use?

We recommend [**Petra Wallet**](https://petra.app/) and [**Martian Aptos Wallet**](https://martianwallet.xyz/).

#### > Can I trade my domain in NFT Market?

Of course. Try listed it in [**Topaz**](https://www.topaz.so/) or [**Souffl3**](https://souffl3.com/).

#### > How to set my profiles picture (avatar) ?&#x20;

First, you should set the primary domain binding on your wallet address.

Then, on the avatar field of the primary domain, fill in your avatar image url and save it.

#### > What is WEB2 Domain name?

When you register a **xxx.apt** in APass, you will get a **xxx.apt.vin** domain name in Web2.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If you use Devnet, the web2 domain will be **xxx.dev.apt.vin.**
{% endhint %}

​Then, you can set a IP Address at "DNS / A Record", and put some html files in the server to make a http website.

#### > Can I create a Decentralized website using my APass domain?

* First, Upload your website files to IPFS, and get the CID.
* Second, Fill CID into the \`IPFS CID\` field of the domain, save it.
* Now you can use the web2 domain to visit it.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are going to use IPFS CID,  keep the CNAME and A record are empty.
{% endhint %}
