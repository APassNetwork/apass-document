# üíÅ What is UniBazaar?

<mark style="color:green;">****</mark>![](../.gitbook/assets/unibazaar\_icon2.png)<mark style="color:green;">****</mark>

**Why not use traditional NFT Marketplace to trade?**

* <mark style="color:red;">**Costly:**</mark> Usually the transaction party needs to pay many fees of 2.5%-15%
* <mark style="color:red;">**Low efficiency:**</mark> If the price is not right, the transaction usually needs to wait for a long time, and the price is repeatedly revised during the period, causing the asset to be idle for a long time.

**Why not use a wallet to trade?**

* <mark style="color:red;">**Fraud, Scam**</mark>\
  A seller or buyer could be deceiving you with what appears to be fake assets. Since there is no authoritative intermediary, there may be a bad situation where the other party disappears without trading after the assets are issued.
* <mark style="color:red;">**Difficult to use**</mark>\
  Usually, the NFT transaction function attached to the wallet requires both parties to use the same wallet to realize
* <mark style="color:red;">**Management Difficulties**</mark>\
  Usually, wallets don't have transaction logs. This makes it difficult to track and analyze the status of many transactions.

<mark style="color:green;">**UniBazaar perfectly solves the above problems.**</mark>&#x20;

After holding an APass domain name, you can become a free member, and you can immediately enjoy completely free, safe and fast transactions of any asset.
