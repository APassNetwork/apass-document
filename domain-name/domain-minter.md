# ‚õè Domain Minter

Each domain name can mint $APC oncetime for every 24 hours. The amount of rewards is determined by one's own generation, and the top-level parent domain name length.

> **The mathematical formula**\
> MINT\_ONE\_DAY = ( 0.2 \* ( 8 - MIN( 6, DOMAIN\_LENGTH ) ) ) / POW( 2, GEN )

If it is not a ZERO domain name (subdomain or grandchild domain), 20% of these rewards will be fed back to the father.

To participate in "Domains Minter", you need to

> 1. Have a Passport domain name on the mainnet.
> 2. Enter the NFT CARD tab of the My Domains interface, collecting your $APC once a day.
> 3. It is worth mentioning that you can increase the number of purchased subdomains by upgrading your domain name. Subdomains also have minting rights, and each subdomain will return a portion of $APC to the main domain after each collecting. Note: The number of collectable $APC per day is not cumulative, collecting daily would be ideal.
